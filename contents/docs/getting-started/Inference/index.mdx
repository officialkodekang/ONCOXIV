### Step 10.1: Predict on Individual Images
- *Function*: predict_image() to predict the class of a single input image.
  - *Binary and Subtype Prediction*: Predicts both whether the image is Benign or Malignant and the subtype if applicable.
  - *Visualization*: Displays the input image along with the predicted labels.
  - *Purpose*: Demonstrates model's ability to make individual predictions, useful for real-world inference scenarios.

## Conclusion
All tasks completed successfully, and the model is capable of effectively classifying blood cell cancer images into relevant categories. This project demonstrates the use of a multitask learning approach with ResNet for both binary and subtype classification, leveraging shared features for improved performance.

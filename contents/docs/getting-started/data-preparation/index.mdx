### Step 4.1: Generate CSV File
- *Generate CSV*: Create a CSV file that contains paths to images and their labels (Benign or Malignant, and subtype for Malignant).
  - *Automation*: Labels are derived based on folder names, automating the labeling process and reducing human error.
- *Function*: create_csv(data_dir, csv_filename)
  - Iterates through the dataset directory and extracts information such as image paths and labels.
  - *Purpose*: Provides an organized structure for efficiently loading data during training.

### Step 4.2: Split Data into Train, Validation, and Test Sets
- *Split Data*: Split data into training, validation, and test sets using stratified splitting.
  - *Training Set*: Used to train the model.
  - *Validation Set*: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
  - *Test Set*: Used to evaluate the final model's performance.
- *Stratified Splitting*: Ensures each class is represented proportionally in all subsets.
  - *Function*: split_data(csv_file, train_csv, val_csv, test_csv, val_size=0.1, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)
  - *Purpose*: Helps maintain a balanced dataset, reducing bias and improving generalization.

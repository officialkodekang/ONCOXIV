### Custom Dataset Class
- *Custom Dataset*: Create a class (BloodCellDataset) to handle image data.
  - *Function*: __getitem__() and __len__() methods to load and provide individual samples.
  - *Read CSV*: Loads the CSV file, reads images, and applies necessary transformations.
  - *Integration*: Easily integrates with PyTorch's DataLoader API for efficient data loading.

### Data Transformations
- *Training Transforms*:
  - *Resizing*: Resize images to a fixed size.
  - *Data Augmentation*: Apply random flips, rotations, and color jitter to introduce variations.
  - *Purpose*: Helps the model generalize better by learning features under different conditions.
- *Validation and Test Transforms*:
  - *Normalization*: Only resize and normalize images (no augmentation).
  - *Purpose*: Maintain consistency during evaluation.

### Data Loaders
- *Create Data Loaders*:
  - *Training Data Loader*: Loads training data in batches with shuffle=True to improve generalization.
  - *Validation and Test Loaders*: Load validation and test data without shuffling.
  - *Batch Size*: Set to 16 for all data loaders.
  - *Purpose*: Efficiently load data in batches, reducing memory usage and speeding up training.

### Step 9.1: Plot Training Curves
- *Metrics Visualization*: Plot the training and validation loss, binary accuracy, and subtype accuracy over epochs.
  - *Purpose*: Helps visualize the model's learning progress and identify overfitting or underfitting.

### Step 9.2: Evaluate on Test Set
- *Evaluation Function*: evaluate_model() to assess the performance on the test dataset.
  - *Metrics*: Classification report and confusion matrix for both binary and subtype classification.
  - *Purpose*: Provides detailed insights into model performance across different classes.

### Step 9.3: Display Predictions
- *Display Predictions*: Visualize predictions along with actual labels on the test set.
  - *Function*: show_predictions() to display a few samples with predictions.
  - *Purpose*: Verify how well the model performs on unseen data.

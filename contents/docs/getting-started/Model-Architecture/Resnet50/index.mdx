### Step 7.1: Multitask Model without BatchNorm1d
- *Base Model (ResNet50)*:
  - *Layers*: ResNet50 consists of 50 layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
  - *Residual Learning*: Residual connections help train very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
  - *Pretrained Model*: The pretrained ResNet50 is used as a feature extractor, leveraging its ability to extract rich features from medical images.

### Model Modifications
- *Remove Final Layer*: The final fully connected (fc) layer of ResNet50 is replaced with two separate heads:
  1. *Binary Classifier Head*:
     - *Architecture*: Linear layer (256 units) -> ReLU -> Dropout -> Linear layer (2 output units).
     - *Purpose*: Classify images as Benign or Malignant.
  2. *Subtype Classifier Head*:
     - *Architecture*: Linear layer (256 units) -> ReLU -> Dropout -> Linear layer (3 output units).
     - *Purpose*: Classify malignant images into subtypes (Pre-B, Pro-B, early Pre-B).

### Multitask Learning
- *Simultaneous Learning*: The model simultaneously learns to classify images as Benign/Malignant and, if Malignant, classify the subtype.
  - *Shared Representations*: Multitask learning helps leverage shared representations, improving overall performance.

### Freezing Early Layers
- *Frozen Layers*: Freeze the early layers of ResNet50 to prevent them from being updated during training.
  - *Purpose*: The early layers typically learn general features (e.g., edges, textures) applicable to a wide range of images.
  - *Benefits*: Reduces computational cost and prevents overfitting, especially with limited data.

### Forward Pass
- *Feature Extraction*: Pass the input image through the base ResNet50 model to extract features.
- *Binary Classification*: Use the binary classifier head to determine if the image is Benign or Malignant.
- *Subtype Classification*: If classified as Malignant, pass the features through the subtype classifier head to determine the specific subtype.

### Overfitting Prevention
- *Dropout Layers*: Dropout layers in the classifier heads randomly disable neurons during training.
  - *Purpose*: Helps prevent overfitting, which is crucial when working with medical data that often has limited samples.

### Step 9.1: Plot Training Curves

- *Metrics Visualization*: Plot the loss, binary accuracy, and subtype accuracy for both training and validation sets across all epochs.
  - *Purpose*: Helps understand how the model is learning and whether it is overfitting or underfitting.

### Step 9.2: Evaluate on Test Set

- *Evaluation Function*: The evaluate_model() function is used to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
  - *Metrics*: Generates a classification report and confusion matrix for both binary and subtype classification.
  - *Purpose*: Provides a detailed breakdown of model performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

### Step 9.3: Display Predictions

- *Display Predictions*: The show_predictions() function is used to display model predictions for a few test samples.
  - *Visualization*: Shows the true and predicted labels for each sample.
  - *Purpose*: Visually verify the model's predictions and understand its performance on individual images.

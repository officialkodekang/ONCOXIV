## Step 7: Define Model Architecture with VGG Backbone

### Step 7.1: Multitask Model with VGG Backbone

- *Base Model (VGG16)*:
  - *Layers*: The model uses VGG16 with batch normalization (vgg16_bn). VGG16 is known for its simplicity with a stack of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.
  - *Features Extraction*: The features attribute from the pretrained VGG16 model is used, which includes convolutional and pooling layers for effective feature extraction.
  - *Average Pooling Layer*: The avgpool layer from VGG16 is retained to reduce the spatial dimensions before feeding into the fully connected layers.

### Model Modifications

- *Freeze Convolutional Layers*:
  - *Frozen Layers*: The convolutional layers are optionally frozen to utilize pretrained features without further modification.
  - *Purpose*: Helps reduce computational costs and prevent overfitting, especially with a limited dataset.

- *Task-Specific Heads*:
  1. *Binary Classifier Head*:
     - *Architecture*: Linear layer (512 * 7 * 7 to 256) -> ReLU (in-place) -> Dropout (0.5) -> Linear layer (256 to 2).
     - *Purpose*: Classify images as Benign or Malignant.
  2. *Subtype Classifier Head*:
     - *Architecture*: Linear layer (512 * 7 * 7 to 256) -> ReLU (in-place) -> Dropout (0.5) -> Linear layer (256 to 3).
     - *Purpose*: Classify malignant images into subtypes (Pre-B, Pro-B, early Pre-B).

### Multitask Learning

- *Simultaneous Learning*: The model is designed to perform multitask learning by sharing a common feature extractor (the VGG16 convolutional layers) and using two different classification heads.
  - *Shared Representations*: This approach allows the model to learn shared features beneficial for both tasks, thus improving overall accuracy.

### Forward Pass

- *Feature Extraction*: Pass the input image through the features layers and then apply average pooling.
- *Flattening*: Flatten the output from the pooling layer before feeding it to the classifier heads.
- *Binary Classification*: Use the binary classifier head to determine if the image is Benign or Malignant.
- *Subtype Classification*: If the image is classified as Malignant, pass it through the subtype classifier head to determine the specific subtype.

### Overfitting Prevention

- *Dropout Layers*: Dropout layers are included in the classifier heads to help reduce overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
  - *Purpose*: Helps the model generalize better, particularly important for medical data with a limited number of samples.

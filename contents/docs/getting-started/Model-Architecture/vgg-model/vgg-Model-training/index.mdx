### Step 8.1: Training Process

- *Training Function*: The train_model() function is used to train the VGG-based multitask model.
  - *Early Stopping*: Stops training if no improvement is observed for a defined number of epochs (patience).
  - *Training and Validation Phases*: Each epoch consists of a training phase followed by a validation phase.
  - *Loss Calculation*: Uses a combined loss for both binary and subtype classification tasks.
- *Loss Functions*: Cross-entropy loss is used for both classification tasks.
- *Optimizer*: Adam optimizer with weight decay is used to help regularize the model.
- *Learning Rate Scheduler*: A step learning rate scheduler is applied to adjust the learning rate periodically during training.

### Step 8.2: Training Parameters

- *Epochs*: The model is trained for 25 epochs.
- *Batch Size*: A batch size of 16 is used for training and validation.
- *Patience*: The early stopping mechanism is set to stop training after 5 epochs without improvement.
- *Checkpointing*: The best model weights are saved based on validation accuracy.

### Step 5.1: Visualize Class Distribution
- *Class Distribution*: Visualize the number of images in each class.
  - *Purpose*: Identify any class imbalance, which could negatively impact model performance.
  - *Visualization*: Includes bar charts showing the distribution of Benign vs. Malignant and subtype classes.

### Step 5.2: Display Sample Images
- *Sample Images*: Display a few sample images from the dataset.
  - *Purpose*: Understand the nature of images (e.g., variations in color, size, quality).
  - *Verification*: Helps verify the correctness of labels and identify potential challenges (e.g., poor image quality).
  - *Visualization*: Displays a set of images with their respective labels.

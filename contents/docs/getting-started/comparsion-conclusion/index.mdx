        | *Overall Convergence* | Moderate            | Faster               |

#### Key Observations

1. *Accuracy and Convergence*:
   - The ResNet model consistently outperformed the VGG model in both binary and subtype classification, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs.
   - ResNet's faster convergence indicates a more efficient learning process, likely due to its deeper architecture and residual connections, which facilitate the flow of gradients during backpropagation.

2. *Generalization*:
   - ResNet demonstrated better generalization capabilities, as evident from its higher validation and test accuracies for both tasks.
   - The VGG model, while achieving high performance, did not generalize as well as ResNet, especially in the subtype classification task.

3. *Subtype Classification*:
   - ResNet reached perfect accuracy for subtype classification, highlighting its ability to capture nuanced features for differentiating between similar classes (e.g., Pre-B, Pro-B, early Pre-B).
   - The VGG model performed well but had minor discrepancies in recall for specific subtypes, which may be attributed to its less complex architecture compared to ResNet.

4. *Overfitting Prevention*:
   - Both models utilized dropout effectively to prevent overfitting. However, ResNet's deeper structure and use of residual connections provided an edge in retaining generalization during training.

### Conclusion

- *Model Selection*: The ResNet model is recommended for blood cell cancer classification due to its superior performance in both binary and subtype classification tasks. Its ability to achieve high accuracy in fewer epochs demonstrates efficient learning and better generalization.
- *VGG Limitations*: While VGG is simpler and performed well, its accuracy and generalization lagged slightly behind ResNet. It may still be a viable option in environments with limited computational resources where a lighter model is preferred.
- *Future Work*: Investigating ensemble methods combining ResNet and VGG, or further optimizing hyperparameters for VGG, could yield improved results. Additionally, exploring other state-of-the-art architectures like EfficientNet could provide even greater performance gains.

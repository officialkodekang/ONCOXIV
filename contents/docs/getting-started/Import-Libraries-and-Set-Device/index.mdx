title: Import Libraries and Set Device
description: Prepare the environment by importing essential libraries.
---

Prepare the environment by importing essential libraries and configuring the device for optimized model training.

- *Import Libraries*: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, deep learning, and evaluation.
- *Set Device*: Configure the device for training (cuda if available, otherwise cpu).
  - *Purpose*: Using a GPU significantly accelerates the training process, especially for a deep learning model like ResNet.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchvision import models, transforms
from torchvision.utils import make_grid
from PIL import Image

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Device configuration
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
print(f'Using device: {device}')

Prepare the environment by importing essential libraries and configuring the device for optimized model training.
- *Import Libraries*: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, deep learning, and evaluation.
- *Set Device*: Configure the device for training (cuda if available, otherwise cpu).
  - *Purpose*: Using a GPU significantly accelerates the training process, especially for a deep learning model like ResNet.
